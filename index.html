          <p>This is not my favorite movie, but it might be my favorite movie to look at. Kubrick’s obsessive attention to detail is famous, and you can really feel it here. Every square inch (pixel?) of the screen has been carefully considered. As one small example, the typography alone is worthy of this <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/01/31/2001-a-space-odyssey/">lengthy, fascinating analysis.</a></p>

          <p>“What’d you think, Mr. Littlejeans?”</p>
          <p><i>Rushmore</i> has always been my go-to answer for my favorite movie. It didn’t always feel true, but it was close enough, and it’s a sort of interesting but uncontroversial answer. I hadn’t seen it in years and years, though, and was a bit nervous to revisit it. It meant a lot to me growing up, and I was worried it might not hold up.</p>
          <p>And boy, did it mean a lot to me as a 16-year-old when it came out. It not only opened up a wider world of movies to me, but a wider world in general. It hit me right in my developing sense of humor, and appealed to the instant nostalgia for the present you only really feel as a teenager. And I mean, it gave me a bunch of new bands to explore. It helped develop my aesthetic sense. All of a sudden I knew about typefaces. It gave me a new definition of what cool could be. I had magazine clippings about this movie hanging on my bedroom wall.</p>
          <p>Anyway, it holds up and I still love it. Still makes me LOL. It’s impossible for me to have an opinion about it that isn’t colored by my existing relationship with it, but I don’t really want to watch it without that existing relationship. That’s kind of the point.</p>

          <p>This movie famously opened to mixed reviews and took a while to get a critical reappraisal, but it's obviously considered a classic now. That said, I still think it might be underappreciated relative to the rest of Kubrick's work. This might be his most successful marriage of stunning visuals with story.</p>

          <p>This is a vibrant, sweaty, colorful, moving masterpiece and Spike Lee’s most important joint in a career of remarkable movies.</p>
          <p>Watching this (and all of Spike Lee’s movies) this year, with Trump in the White House and George Floyd and so many others dead, was one of the more eye-opening cultural experiences of my life. The fact that Spike has been talking about this stuff in his movies for decades and I’m just now starting to get it is a real sign of my white privilege.</p>
          <p>On top of all that, even with the darkness and heavy themes floating around the edges, this is still somehow a joyful, fun movie experience.</p>

          <p>Check another one off my list of movies I’ve been meaning to watch for literal decades. And just like Alien, this more than lived up to the hype.</p>
          <p>I was always kind of scared to delve into David Cronenberg because of my squeamishness about his famous body horror stuff, but this is the fourth one I’ve watched in like two weeks and I’m loving them. Here, particularly, the body horror, while fantastically gross, is played mostly for laughs. And it’s very funny! I mean, when his ear falls off? Classic gag.</p>
          <p>I also love how Cronenberg jumps right into it. The two main characters meet each other at a party at the same time we’re meeting them, then head immediately to his lab. Not an ounce of fat on this thing.</p>
          <p>This movie could not, would not, and should not exist without Jeff Goldblum.</p>

          <p>This feels like a bit of a step towards more traditional stories/storytelling, at least relative to his earlier movies, and that’s not a criticism. I love Yorgos at his weirdest, but I also can’t wait to see what he does when he’s working at least partially within the constraints of a more “normal” type of  filmmaking, if only to see how he ends up breaking the rules.</p>

          <p>This movie has maybe the most Martin Scorsese stuff of any Martin Scorsese movie. Crime, drugs, sex, rock & roll, Leo, voiceover, camera tricks, biting humor, the American Dream turning into a nightmare, moral absolutism disguised as moral ambiguity. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this seems to be a particular favorite among Scorsese diehards. It also gets better every time I watch it.</p>
          <p>That said, if you don’t like the typical Marty stuff, you might think this is overly-long, indulgent, and a bit problematic. But even you would have to agree the Jonah Hill performance is just so fun, right?</p>

          <p>Kubrick doesn’t have a heart and he doesn’t always even have a story, but what keeps me coming back to him are his striking visuals, his design, and his sense of scope. You can feel his growing confidence in those things here, but he hasn’t yet hit the heights that he would in his next few movies. Also, Sellers is a genius, but “funny” Kubrick isn’t really my favorite Kubrick. He’s too clinical about it.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee is not an indulgent filmmaker, at least when it comes to length. Most of his movies come in at two hours and change, occasionally even less. When he stretches out a bit, like with this movie and something like <i>When the Levees Broke</i>, you know he has a lot to say. And there are few people I’d rather listen to talk about something they’re passionate about than Spike Lee.</p>
          <p>And at over three hours, it still doesn’t feel like there is a wasted moment (OK, maybe some of the early bits). That’s a testament not only to the story being told, but also to the way Spike is telling it. <i>Do the Right Thing</i> is his masterpiece, but this might be his most confident filmmaking.</p>
          <p>It almost feels like a cliche, but I have to say it: this is the role Denzel Washington was born to play.</p>
          <p>Might be my favorite use of Spike’s famous double dolly shot.</p>

          <p>I like a lot of Paul Schrader's movies, maybe most of them. This is the one that really changed how I think about him, though. It's just oozing with creativity, both in its structure and style. The decision to interweave the biographical episodes from Yukio Mishima's life with staged scenes from his novels allows the movie to paint with a full spectrum of human emotions that wouldn't have been possible with only one or the other.</p>
          <p>And the score. Maybe the thing I was most grateful to have been introduced to by a movie this year was this score, by Philip Glass.</p>

          <p>This is right on the line between four-and-a-half and five stars for me. It’s not without flaws, although I think a lot of the flaws people mention are just intentional noir elements that modern viewers have trouble with, like the slow-ish, moody pace and the flatness of some of the characters. But in the end it gets the full five stars, because the visuals and set design and costume design and makeup and lighting and cinematography are so transcendently good. Almost oppressively good.</p>
          <p>Speaking of oppressive, I love the close-ups and claustrophobic framing in this movie. We’re always either right up in someone’s eerily lit face or across the street from them, with people and cars dashing across our vision. I’ve never seen this in a theater, and I’d really like to.</p>
          <p>This is just such a cool movie. Maybe <i>the coolest</i> movie. It’s almost a cross between <i>Alien</i> and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, stylistically, and that's not a combination I’d kick out of bed for eating noodles.</p>
          <p>Ridley doesn’t really take swings like this anymore. I’d love to know what effect the failure of his next movie, Legend, had on his filmmaking. He seemed to want to take far fewer risks as his career went on.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee tells this story perfectly, each section building on the last. Stories of individual victims woven with an analysis of government failure and a history lesson.

          <p>I was kind of blown away by this one. I knew very little about Lil Peep before watching this. I’d read a couple of stories about him when he died and I’d listened to, and liked, a few of his songs years ago, but I wasn’t sure how interested I’d be in his story, particularly at two hours. But he is such a captivating presence, and there are so many compelling characters around him that are able to speak eloquently about what he meant to them that I shouldn’t have worried. This is one of the best music documentaries I’ve seen.</p>
          <p>Lil Peep, as many people say throughout the movie, was undeniably a star, and his charisma comes through the screen. He had a Kurt Cobain quality that might have been cultivated but wasn’t inauthentic.</p>
          <p>The real star of this movie, though, is his grandpa, who comes across as perhaps the most thoughtful human being to ever walk the Earth. I want a documentary about him. I found out after watching that my father-in-law knows him, so maybe he can convince him to become pen pals with my kids or something.</p>

          <p>I’ve been watching all of David Cronenberg’s movies in order, and I’d not particularly been looking forward to this one. I didn’t know anything about it, but, I mean...the title. It certainly didn’t seem like a movie that would age well.</p>
          <p>But it turns out that this is the best movie about video games (the only good movie about video games?) ever made. I mean, is David Cronenberg a gamer? Because this movie was made when I was playing my Dreamcast and it’s still the best representation in a movie of what playing a video game is like. It honestly barely feels dated. Has game design really advanced this little?</p>
          <p>That said, I still cringed whenever anyone said “Eggsssistaahhhnz.”</p>
          <p>I do need to note that I suspect I wouldn’t have liked this nearly as much if I hadn’t spent the past few weeks watching Cronenberg movies. I suspect the tone, had I just walked into a theater in 1999, would have been a bit jarring.</p>
          <p>Why were people so into reality blurring movies like this in the late-90s?</p>

          <p>As soon as I picked up on how we, the viewers, were with the women in the wagon trail, and like them, we couldn't really hear what the men ahead of us, making decisions for us, were saying, I knew I was in the hands of a great director.

          <p>I don’t know how true to life this telling was, and maybe if I did this would feel a tad exploitative, but I doubt it. I also don’t know how authentic to the real Christine Chubbuck Rebecca Hall’s performance is, but I know that she is completely transformed here, and amazing. I mean, the puppet show scenes alone. This is such a delicately, and sympathetically, told version of what could have been such a sensationalized story. I found the documenting of the details of Christine’s life to be honestly kind of moving.</p>
          <p>I can’t help but wonder what someone who watched this without knowing what was coming thought of it. I knew the story going in, and I found the process of developing such a sympathy for a character whom I knew would come to such a tragic end, a real life tragic end at that, to be relatively horrifying.</p>

          <p>There aren’t a ton of movies set in San Francisco, but most of them are cool.</p>
          <p>Honestly one of the best directed horror or horror-adjacent movies I’ve seen. Technically, artistically, visually, emotionally. Bravo, Mr. Kaufman! I really love watching an old movie that I’ve heard of my whole life but never had much interest in seeing and realizing as I watch that the reason I’ve heard the name so much is because it’s great.</p>
          <p>Donald Sutherland, Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy. This casting director had a thing for guys with big, interesting faces.</p>
          <p>One final note: the dog with the human head REALLY surprised me and honestly kind of freaked me out. Again, bravo, Mr. Kaufman.</p>

          <p>Ridley Scott has one job and that’s making movies and he does that job well.</p>
          <p>A classic. Legitimately funny, and has a realism to it, at least in the first half, that I really responded to. Things get a bit goofy near the end, unfortunately. I would personally get this movie down to an even two hours by cutting all the horny trucker stuff. The almost slapstick tone of those parts, combined with the Blues Brothers-esque car chase scene that follows, really undermines the iconic ending.</p>
          <p>But Sarandon and Davis make it all endlessly watchable. They both have such amazing, expressive faces.</p>

          <p>I wish Delroy Lindo got to play roles like this more often. He's such a large physical presence that he usually gets pidgeonholed into tougher types, but his performance as the loving father here might be my favorite of his.</p>

          <p>When I lived in Boston I used to get lunch at the McDonald’s in South Station every day. I started going because I loved the Chicken Selects they had for a while, but then they got rid of them and I kept going anyway. It’s not something I’m proud of.</p>
          <p>There was always a fair share of shady characters hanging out in the upstairs dining area of the South Station food court, but you got used to it and stopped thinking about it after a while. One day I was eating my bland hamburger and a guy behind me in a scuffed-up black leather jacket started talking to me. At first I was just nodding along politely, hoping he’d leave me alone and let me get back to my podcast.</p>
          <p>But then something happened and all of a sudden this guy was reeling me in. I mean, you could tell by looking at him that there was no way he worked in the Celtics’ front office. But he whipped out a beat-up schedule he got at Dunkin’ Donuts and there I was handing him $20 and pointing to an upcoming game against the Bulls, and off he went to make a call and get me my promised courtside seats. I mean, even as it was happening I knew he was getting one over on me. But it worked.</p>
          <p>This movie worked on me the same way the first time I saw it. And it still works.</p>

          <p>Other than that, I really liked this movie. Weird internet culture is endlessly fascinating to me. Bitcoin dweebs driving around in Lamborghinis, greasy incels wallowing in filth, tales from the dark side of bodybuilding message boards (there is no light side of bodybuilding message boards).</p>
          <p>Matt Furie has a really joyful, pure energy that reminded me a lot of the hero of another favorite documentary of mine, Steve Wiebe from <i>The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters</i>. I mean when he is being deposed or whatever and corrects the lawyer who says Hamburgler instead of Mayor McCheese? Funnier than anything in <i>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.</i>, and this is coming from a guy who really like <i>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.</i></p>
          <p>Very well made as well! I enjoyed the ebbs and flows of the story. The pacing and diversions really stood out compared to the monotonous march of facts in the documentary I watched last night, <i>Totally Under Control</i>. Beautiful animation that reminded me a lot of the credits sequence of <i>Bojack Horseman</i>. Nice use of Daniel Johnston.</p>
          <p>This was the perfect doc for the night before Election Day. Political, but hopeful, dark around the edges, but kind of beautiful at the center.</p>

          <p>There are a lot of Canadian actors acting their Canadian hearts out in this movie. God bless ‘em. Robert Silverman is GREAT as the disgruntled ex-therapy patient.</p>
          <p>I honestly thought this was a really interesting movie. There’s a lot happening. Marriage, divorce, mental illness, child abuse, addiction, licking a bloody newborn, alcoholism, predatory doctors, cute teachers with short, angular haircuts. On top of that there’s murder and other spooky stuff. Has this movie been remade? It seems like it should have been.</p>
          <p>This is the third third Cronenberg movie I’ve seen this month and I’m thinking seriously about just watching all of them.</p>

          <p>It’s a shame Terrence Howard is an insane person and also just kind of a bad person, because man can he act. He’s great here, as is everyone else. Perfect casting. This is probably my favorite Hugh Jackman performance. Jake Gyllenhaal is never totally convincing to me as these gritty, tough types, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t totally magnetic. Viola Davis, Maria Bello, etc. etc.</p>
          <p>There’s a lot of Fincher DNA here, but even though this is a beautifully shot movie, it isn’t as stylized as Fincher might have made it. This is to the benefit of the movie for the most part, but also somehow makes it even more grim. Maybe too grim. A tough watch.</p>

          <p>Orson Welles is crazy, man. I can’t believe a guy who started out in RADIO in the Thirties ended up making this movie in the Seventies. It’s all quick cuts and extreme close-ups and jittery handheld and newsreel footage and freeze frames. It’s almost like he was too creative for his own good. I wonder what his career would have been like if he had to work a bit harder for it.</p>

          <p>Julianne Moore is divisive in my household. My wife has disliked her ever since she saw, and hated, Far from Heaven. I’m not a fan, per se, but I’ve always stuck up for her. But she doesn’t work for me here. God bless her, she is fully committed and really going there in this role, but somehow she’s just not a fit.</p>
          <p>Everyone else in this movie is killing it. Mia Wasikowska is mesmerizing. John Cusack owns it. Olivia Williams, Robert Pattinson. Even the twerp playing the child star is good!</p>
          <p>I’m now up to date on David Cronenberg. Watching all of his movies has been incredibly rewarding. He might be my new favorite director? I can’t wait to see what he does next.</p>

          <p>There was a time when humanity was producing so many good comedies that we not only made a parody of the Johnny Cash biopic, we made it this good, with this cast, with songs this good, with this much full-frontal nudity, with this many jokes. Just joke after joke until you pass out. And even though we made it that good, better than it ever needed to be, it still kind of came and went and was sort of forgotten. That’s how many good comedies there were at the time.</p>

          <p>I mean, I don’t hide the fact that I’m dumb and basic, and this is a well-made, Ridley Scott-directed, flashy crime movie starring Denzel Washington. I’ll take it. Four and a half stars. Roll it back and let’s watch it a second time.</p>
          <p>I’m actually surprised this movie has such a middling reputation, though. Usually when I like movies that most people don’t, or most people could take or leave, I can guess what it is that rubs others the wrong way. I’m not sure what the disconnect is here, other than my predilection for the genre.</p>
          <p>Such a great cast. I love Ruby Dee in this. Josh Brolin is a delightful scumbag. Denzel is Denzel. John Hawkes makes every single thing he’s in better.</p>
          <p>If this movie had been made 15 years earlier it would have aired 10,000 times on TNT.</p>

          <p>“I’m finally making one for ME!” - David Cronenberg on the set of this movie, probably.</p>
          <p>I honestly don’t feel qualified to really comment on the connection between sex and violence in this movie and the controversy around it. Instead, I want to say that this is a great example of something I really love about Cronenberg’s work, the way he can jam his movies full of symbolism and have thematic elements right on the surface without it feeling too obvious or showy or student film-ish. I think it’s because the themes and symbols he’s working with are so primeval.</p>

          <p>I’ve noticed I say “fun” too often when describing movies, so I’m trying to work on that, but what a fun cast! Brooke Adams, whom I just saw for the first time in Invasion of the Body Snatchers and am falling in love with. Christopher Walken doing his usual thing, but very effectively here, smiling like a madman when haltingly asking his doctor if he’s going to die. Martin Sheen, playing a young Jed Bartlett by way of Donald Trump, a mashup that really twisted up my soul.</p>
          <p>The structure of this movie is really strange. I’d read a two-sentence plot synopsis before watching this, but it basically only described the events of the first twenty minutes and last twenty minutes. The rest of the movie just kind of bounced around, years passing here, months here, locations changing. I didn’t mind it, but I definitely noticed it.</p>
          <p>Both this and The Fly make me very curious about what would have happened if Cronenberg had really leaned into mainstream, big budget filmmaking. But I’m sure the 90s would have ruined him if he had.</p>

          <p><i>Full Metal Jacket</i> and <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> both really suffer from the fact that Stanley Kubrick didn’t want to leave England and film on location. I mean, they’re both great, but the sets feel so artificial. This is not Vietnam, and this is not the Hollywood version of Vietnam, and this doesn't even feel like what the British version of Hollywood's version of Vietnam would look like. This feels like Stanley Kubrick found a place to film six miles up the road from his house that he decided was good enough.</p>
          <p>And I guess that's kind of who late-career Stanley Kubrick is. A guy who decides things are good enough who used to be a guy for whom nothing was good enough.</p>

I mean, <i>What's Up Doc?</i> is all style, and I love it. Bogdanovich is not whom I look to for small town Texas profundity.</p>
          <p>Seventies Cybill Shepherd is near the top of my all-time celebrity crushes.</p>

          <p>Top, top tier Paul Schrader. It's such a dark, depressing story, and Schrader directs with such a light, playful touch, almost like this is a sitcom from the same era as Hogan's Heroes. And it's such a great, smart decision. What a romp!</p>
          <p>Greg Kinnear is great here, which I guess makes sense, since he also seems like someone who is outwardly nice and wholesome but has some darkness hidden inside.</p>

          <p>This movie is bursting with creativity, and, as the self-financed debut of a new filmmaker, it’s kind of a remarkable achievement. It’s tight as a drum and is incredibly visually stylish (although it was sometimes a bit hard to see exactly what was going on). It alternates between swooping shots through and around the small town setting as characters move from one place to another and long, quiet monologues as people describe their experiences or theories about what is happening. Eventually the whole thing becomes strangely hypnotic.</p>
          <p>Great performances by both of the two leads, particularly Sierra McCormick. Within minutes of the movie starting she has established who her character is, and more importantly, what her character wants.</p>
          <p>The movie doesn’t need the Twilight Zone framing device, and it’s honestly a bit distracting, especially considering the previously-mentioned hypnotic effect of everything else that’s going on. It is by no means a fatal flaw, though, and easily ignored.</p>

          <p>It’s very confusing that there’s a character named Sizemore and another character played by Tom Sizemore.</p>
          <p>Speaking of Sizemore, every war movie needs someone who doesn’t flinch at the bullets and explosions, and he fills that role admirably here. The whole cast is great, or at the very least interesting.</p>
          <p>I know some people find the action in this movie chaotic and difficult to follow, but I would argue that in the hands of anyone less visually talented than Ridley Scott it would have been much worse. He does a sometimes amazing job of establishing the geography of each scene. The overall geography of Mogadishu is a bit murkier, but that’s less vital.</p>
          <p>I honestly don’t know enough about this particular situation or the region as a whole to comment thoughtfully on the politics of this movie, so I won’t really try. It didn’t feel overly jingoistic or war porn-y to my admittedly pretty tolerant eyes, but none of the Somalis here are people in any real sense, and there were a couple of moments of imperialism that made me think, “Oh right, Ridley Scott is British.” Those, plus a few particularly tin-eared moments of dialogue, keep me from really giving this a full rave, but overall it shows a lot of restraint, and is worth watching just for the bracing intensity it manages to maintain.</p>

          <p>There was a moment in the VH1 Behind the Music episode about Tom Petty where he talked about how much of a bummer it is to have someone try to burn your house down when you're in it that for whatever reason cracked me and one of my dumb high school friends up, and we would imitate his Gainesville drawl and talk to each other about it.</p>

          <p>OK, this is one of the strangest movies I’ve ever seen, so both you and Davey Cronenberg can forgive me for taking a bit to get into it. But once I begin to vaguely understand what was going on, and got the surrealistic, hallucinogenic, spy noir vibe, I couldn’t help but admire the audacious risk-taking going on here. Cronenberg is a true pop auteur, making movies no one else could even conceive of, and making them twice as entertaining as they need to be.</p>
          <p>I might not ever forget the parrot cage scene. And I certainly will never forgive it.</p>

          <p>The actress playing Vicky is really fun and charismatic and continues a proud tradition of great best friend characters in Halloween movies. The part where the woman is on the phone and Michael is outside her house and then she goes to lock her doors and Michael sneaks in the back door behind her is maybe my favorite kill in the whole series. I love Judy Greer in everything and her “Gotcha” moment is maybe the best thing in the movie.</p>

          <p>This is the fifth David Cronenberg movie I’ve watched in the last couple of weeks, and I’ve been loving them, and then some of the visuals and ideas in the beginning of this movie are so interesting that I got really excited to watch the rest of it. It felt like Cronenberg was really coming into his own here, and that this might be his first masterpiece.</p>
          <p>That said, it sort of lost the plot and lost some steam as it went along, and I lost a bit of interest. But it turns out that it’s almost like the movie was just holding its breath for the big final brain battle, which was both very cool and very disgusting! Snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>
          <p>I love all these clean, futuristic looking Canadian public spaces and malls! Seems like Cronenberg (at least in the early stuff I've seen) likes to shoot inside malls? Anyway, I love the time machine aspect of seeing these locations.</p>
          <p>This movie also didn’t really need so many shotguns. Anyway, on to Videodrome!</p>

          <p>I don't have anything original to say about this movie at the moment. Instead I'm going to point out how amazing Adam Driver's career has been so far, viewed through the lens (no pun intended, I swear) of directors he's worked with over the last decade or so. Clint Eastwood, Noah Baumbach (three times), Steven Spielberg, the Coen brothers, Jeff Nichols, Jim Jarmusch (twice), Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, Spike Lee, Terry Gilliam, and Ridley Scott. That's remarkable. Clearly he has good taste and clearly great directors want to work with him.</p>
          <p>So yeah, Adam Driver is the best.</p>

          <p>First of all, the Josh Lucas character is such a ridiculously over the top cartoonish villain in such a distracting and unnecessary way. Ugh, I hated all of that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there is some lazy prop work going on here. I mean, I know this feels nitpicky, but it kept taking me out of the movie. Like, the magazines characters were reading were magazines from the era, but they looked 50-years-old. The pages were yellowed. And at one point I spotted a bag of modern day Kroger potato chips.

          <p>There's so much fun to be had with an invisible antagonist, and this movie has almost all of it. The camera circles Elisabeth Moss like a predator. The dialogue feels out of a soap opera some of the time and a few small things took me out of the movie (why does he sound like the smoke monster from <i>Lost</i>?) but overall this just works.</p>

          <p>Listen, I’m the first one to say that you have to let these high-level directors chase their muse, wherever that may lead them, but I really wonder why Cronenberg started making these kind of straightforward crime dramas. <i>A History of Violence</i> is a good movie, and this one is better than <i>A History of Violence</i>, but I can’t help but think that there are two dozen directors who could be making these movies.</p>
          <p>I’m just saying, these are enjoyable thrillers, but David Cronenberg is only going to make so many movies, and I don’t know why these are two of them.</p>
          <p><i>Note: As I thought more about this I realized, sadly, that these were probably the only movies Cronenberg could get funded. Well, they are still good.</i></p>

          <p>I remember liking this movie when it came out, but feeling even then that it needed to be thought of as a guilty pleasure. Lots of people hated it, and the intensity of the hatred only increased when it won Best Picture. And I get it. I mean, this dialogue is, across the board, atrocious. The entire script sucks. So many hackneyed motivations and unbelievable coincidences. The music sounds like a half-baked first draft for Hans Zimmer’s future <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> scores. There are flaws all over the place here.</p>
          <p>But then you get to the first gladiator battle in Rome, and it’s like: “Oh, right, Ridley Scott is one of the most talented visual directors of all time, and this movie rules.” It’s just fun.</p>
          <p>Also, Joaquin Phoenix’s white armor in the final scene is iconic. Joaquin’s entire performance is iconic.</p>

          <p>No one seems to have more fun just making movies than Steven Soderbergh. Sometimes his experimentation and prolificness make some of his stuff feel a bit throwaway, but the movie industry needs him out there messing around.</p>
          <p>Anyway, so as I’m sure I’m the lucky (pun intended!) millionth person to point out (and actually, the movie itself points out), this is basically <i>Ocean’s Eleven</i> but with hillbillies. It’s sometimes a bit too goofy for its own good, but it’s easy and breezy and features what is now my favorite Daniel Craig performance.</p>
          <p>Speaking of hillbillies, I’d be a lot more interested in <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i> if Steven Soderbergh were directing it. Actually, I kind of just want him to make a real NASCAR movie.</p>

          <p>A very straightforward telling of a very strange story. Seriously, the whole time I kept thinking, what are the odds that someone would get amnesia (pretty rare, right?) and also be an identical twin and also from a family harboring this dark of a secret and also be willing to make this documentary?</p>
          <p>The only other thing I would say about this is it seemed to dip its toes into some vaguely gray ethical areas in the telling of this story, but I guess if the twins are consenting, go for it.</p>

          <p>Just like with Spike’s Michael Jackson docs, this is kind of difficult to review now. I mean, as far as I know, none of these guys turned out to be child molesters, but A LOT of this material is problematic and cringeworthy. Mostly a lot of homophobic bits, which for some reason is a staple of every old comedy special. Ugh.</p>
          <p>But a lot of this is undeniably, uproariously hilarious. And it is a fascinating snapshot of a time in comedy.</p>

          <p>If this had been the spare, Kelly Reichardt-esque story of the shockingly Odyssean lengths some young woman have to go to to get an abortion in this country that it’s pretending to be, with the strength of these two lead performances, it would be a near perfect movie. Unfortunately, adornments keep getting added that heighten the reality in a way that clashes with the otherwise realistic tone.</p>
          <p>One relatively benign example of the sort of thing that bothered me here: the suitcase. Why did they have a big heavy suitcase? It’s made very clear that they weren’t planning on staying overnight. We never see what’s in the suitcase, or hear a joking remark about how they overpacked. They aren’t sleeping, and don’t appear to be changing clothes. Even if they did bring some changes of clothes, a backpack each would have sufficed.</p>
          <p>They bring the suitcase because then we get to see them loading it on the bus, passing it over subway turnstiles, carrying it up stairs, endlessly weighing them down. If it’s supposed to be  symbolic of the weight they’re carrying around, OK, I get it. But it doesn’t work in a movie that is otherwise attempting to be so grounded. Details matter in a world this specific, and they add up.</p>
          <p>Still, worth watching for the aforementioned performances and the real gut-wrenching truths of these women’s experiences that don’t get shown to us very often.</p>

          <p>Sacha Baron Cohen is always a good time.</p>
          <p>I came away being really impressed with Maria Bakalova. She basically has to step in to Borat 2, act convincingly as Borat's daughter, and also improvise with all these random weirdos in these uncomfortable situations. And she has to carry a lot of weight, because Sacha can't really play the Borat character in public anymore. That's a lot of pressure!</p>
          <p>The twist near the end should have felt tacked on and forced but somehow felt...satisfying, I guess? I'm predicting I'll watch this again in five or ten years and up it to 4 stars.</p>

It holds up shockingly well. I mean, this is clearly the cream of the crop when it comes to 80s action flicks.</p>
          <p>I guess I just don’t like action movies all that much. And this was way too long. And one of the guys we’re supposed to be rooting for is like, “I don’t use my gun because I shot a kid who had a toy gun once,” and then the climax of the movie is him heroically using his gun again. Not great, Bob!</p>

          <p>No one other than Paul Schrader could have pulled off both cold, Calvinist Grand Rapids and steamy, sleazy Los Angeles so convincingly. If he had dialed back the B movie tone of the second half a bit, this really could have been something. I mean, at one point George C. Scott literally starts crashing through walls. As it is, it’s a flawed but really entertaining movie.</p>

          <p>Greta Thunberg is a fascinating person to watch. I mean, just staring at her face is interesting. I think that’s probably a lot of why she’s been able to have such an impact at such a young age. And that’s also the saving grace of this documentary. Just her constant, closely-framed presence on the screen makes this worth watching.</p>
          <p>But the documentary itself is a bit uneven. It starts out as almost a character study about a driven young girl, but by the end has widened its focus quite a bit, to the detriment of the movie. And in between we spent A LOT of time on a boat.</p>

          <p>All you need to know about Peter Bogdanovich is that this is his first chance to direct good material and he couldn’t help but cast himself in it. This is a kind of a lost gem, though, with solid direction from Bogdanovich, cinematography by László Kovács, and some fun late-career Boris Karloff.</p>

          <p>Let me start by saying that I really liked this and it’s the sort of documentary everyone should watch. Let me also say that I’d heard so many effusive reviews of this before seeing it that I had what were probably unfairly high expectations.</p>
          <p>But it didn’t totally grab me in the gut in the way I was hoping it would, whether that’s on me or it. I think part of the problem is the way the story was told: in black and white, alternating between old and new footage, no narration, no text on screen, no real introduction to all of the people involved or full backstory of the events. It perhaps added to the mood, but the timeline became a bit confusing and I was left with a lot of questions about certain things. I came away admiring and feeling compassion for many of the people in this documentary, but I didn’t feel like I really knew them. The final third or so of the movie is undeniably powerful, though.</p>
          <p>There is quite a list developing over the past few years of movies depicting the hideousness and racism of the American criminal justice system, and this definitely deserves a place near the top of it.</p>

          <p>I was a bit disappointed with this one. I enjoy the contemplative pace Reichardt works at, but her best movies also have an elemental emotional ocean just beneath the surface, or sometimes flooding above it. This one did not move me in that way at all. I liked watching this characters, but I personally didn’t connect with them in any real way.</p>
          <p>Still a beautiful movie, and one I’m glad I watched, but this feels like a step back for a great director after <i>Certain Women</i>, my favorite of her movies.</p>

          <p>David Cronenberg is not a normal human being. And that’s fine! More than fine. That’s why we love him! But when he tries to portray a “normal” suburban family, especially in the first part of this movie, it really doesn’t work. Everything seems off, and not in a weird Lynch-ian way. More in a “is this writing bad or are these actors bad” sort of way.</p>
          <p>Things start rolling once Ed Harris shows up, of course, and then the plot is enough to keep things rolling. But I miss weird Cronenberg.</p>

          <p>So there are like a million problems with the story here, and the movie brushes them away just like it does the science behind the brining. But it finds a way to make the brushing away of problems funny, and I think the movie is probably better off that it didn’t worry too much about logic. “Alexa tell me how to fly here.”</p>
          <p>Seth Rogen is great, particularly as Herschel, and honestly just seems to be underrated as both an actor and a human being. I mean, the guy just makes Garth Ennis tv shows and posts photos of cool ashtrays he makes on Instagram all day long. Keep on keepin’ on.</p>

          <p>People seem to hate this movie, but I’m of the opinion that it’s basically only missing two things that keep it from being great. Unfortunately, those two things are a credible lead actor and any semblance of historical accuracy or nuance in the screenplay.</p>
          <p>That said, this movie is gorgeous. It gets three and a half stars just for the shots of the ships cresting over the waves, banners and flags flapping wildly, against a rich orange sky. I mean, come on.</p>

          <p>Oh man, I can just PICTURE Kevin Spacey in this role and I bet he was terrible.</p>
          <p>How much of this story is “fictionalized for dramatic purposes?” Because this is quite a story! As much as I have come to love and appreciate Ridley Scott, though, this telling of it falls halfway between the way Spielberg would tell it and the way Scorsese would tell it, and that’s kind of true of a lot of his movies. Sometimes that suits the movie, but in this case I think I’d rather have seen the Spielberg or the Scorsese version. Or really just the Scorsese version.</p>

          <p>I keep changing my mind about how much I like this movie. It’s definitely flawed, but I feel like some of the scenes are really going to stick with me. Plus, it’s just SO weird and different and I always appreciate that. Millie Perkins isn’t the greatest actress in the world, but she sure brings a convincingly nervous, unstable, and eventually unhinged energy to this role. The sound design deserves particular notice; throughout the film the flashbacks and more hallucinatory scenes were really elevated by the sound.</p>
          <p>This movie was directed by the guy on whom Marc Maron’s character is based on the tv show <i>Glow</i>, so also there’s that.</p>

          <p>I of course remember this Biosphere stuff (and the Pauly Shore movie) from my childhood. I’ll tell you what, though, I assumed it was, like, NASA, not a bunch of hippies with oil money to burn doing some performance art. I mean, that’s not entirely fair. There is real science happening here, I’m sure. But as soon as they introduced these characters it was obvious they would end up biting off more than they could chew. Society needs weirdos like this, though, operating on the edges of science and art, even if I don’t care to spend much time with them.</p>
          <p>This has an airy (like the Biosphere itself!) vibe that’s charming at first, but feels a bit meandering after a while. I got lulled into such a sleepy state, as a matter of fact, that the sudden introduction of Steve Bannon was even more jarring. Ugh. But there was a story to tell, and the documentary tells it completely and well.</p>

          <p>I had a bit of trouble keeping track of whom all these Canadian guys were supposed to be while watching, but overall this has some good practical effects and real, gross, scares. Marilyn Chambers was surprisingly good, and I enjoyed how this felt grounded in a realism that a lot of movies like this would purposefully avoid or heighten.</p>

          <p><i>“I think I’m gonna choke on the feel-good.”</i> - Famous last words</p>
          <p>Very surprised to discover this movie’s connection to the QAnon conspiracy nonsense while watching it. Where we go one we go all, indeed!</p>
          <p>I was also surprised by this movie in general. I knew nothing other than the name, and I was definitely expecting something more along the lines of <i>The Perfect Storm</i>, not <i>Dead Poets’ Society</i> on the high seas. Things take a Storm-y turn at a certain point, but by the end it’s definitely just Dead Pirates’ Society (I can’t be the first person to make that joke).</p>
          <p>This movie has too much schmaltz, cheese, and those-were-the-60s “they were headed to a little place called the Bay of Pigs” <i>Forrest Gump</i>-isms for it to AT ALL earn its ending. But I’m a sucker for these sorts of movies, or at least the first 75% of this one, even though they don’t particularly speak to my own youth or coming-of-age story at all. I guess that’s probably why I like them.</p>
          <p>Also, this is the only movie that I’m aware of where you get to see Ryan Phillippe pee his pants.</p>
          <p>Ridley did NOT need to do Caroline Goodall like that.</p>

          <p>This reminded me A LOT of Young Life camp, and even though I no longer believe in God, I have to admit that Young Life camp was a lot of fun, other than the time I was dared to eat a massive amount of green beans and ended up vomiting in front of a bunch of people, including some girls whom I’m pretty sure never looked at me the same way again. And I can’t blame them. That was one of those embarrassing moments that really sticks with you, even decades later, you know?</p>
          <p>Anyway, this is the exact sort of quirky indie that I would have hated circa 2008, but I like this one, so I’m sitting here wondering if quirky indies have become better or if I’m just mellowing with age. That said, the last 25 minutes or so really reminded me of what I hated about quirky indies in 2008. So...3.5 stars?</p>

          <p>I agree with probably 80% of the negative things people have said about this, but it’s still satisfying every once in a while to just get down in the muck with a really grimy crime movie, and this one certainly fits the bill.</p>
          <p>For a man who has been knighted by the Queen, Sir Ridley Scott is not afraid of some gruesome violence, but the Brad Pitt scene near the end might be his finest moment in that department. Boy oh boy. And I don’t even know what to say about Cameron Diaz and the Ferrari. The less said the better, probably.</p>

          <p>There is certainly a lot of objectionable content here, although I don’t actually object to all of it. Overall, though, I think this movie does an admirable job of making sense of and filling in gaps in the mythology of the series. This movie hangs together structurally in a way that most slasher films don’t. At all. and Malcolm McDowell as Loomis is inspired casting. If anything, I’m actually underrating it here relative to my true feelings based on the baggage it has with a lot of fans.</p>
          <p>Maybe I’m able to like this movie because I think the original <i>Halloween</i> is so incredibly overrated.</p>

          <p>This movie went places that I can honestly say I wasn't expecting. Not quite the fun romp I thought it might turn out to be.</p>
          <p>This reminds me of a lot of movies in Spike's second tier. The script is kind of mediocre-ish, but the filmmaking is so confident that it makes it fun to watch. Man, can Spike Lee make movies.</p>
          <p>But yeah, this one didn't really come together for me in the end. Lots of great performances, though, including from one of my favorites, Delroy Lindo.</p>

          <p>This is beautiful to look at and is telling an important story that I know very little about, and usually that’s enough for me to love a movie. And the soundtrack should really have put it over the top.</p>
          <p>But the pacing is all over the place and the story is strangely disjointed. The dialogue is stilted and annoyingly philosophical, and it’s all addressed squarely to the audience rather than to any other character in the movie. The whole thing is so self-serious. No one in this movie wants you to think they’ve ever even heard a story about someone having fun, let alone had fun themselves.</p>
          <p>Anyway, ACAB.</p>

          <p>It’s so weird to watch one of these Bush-era War on Terror movies now! I forgot these movies existed! I kind of forgot the War on Terror existed!</p>
          <p>I wish this movie had been directed by, like, Peter Berg and starred Nicholas Cage so I could just dismiss it outright, because the politics, the MORALS of much of this movie are repugnant. I mean, people are very casually doing horrible things here, and we’re supposed to be like, “OK, cool. Leo looks cool with this beard.” But instead it’s Ridley Scott and Leonardo DiCaprio, so it’s engaging and visually interesting and goes down real easy.</p>
          <p>It is dense, though. Not in a packed full of ideas way — if anything, this movie is almost devoid of ideas. Just in a “whoa, these guys are on a phone call saying a lot of names very fast here, better pay attention” sort of way. I had to rewind because I’d gotten distracted several times,</p>
          <p>It seems like Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Russell Crowe could have figured out something cooler to do together.</p>

          <p>This movie definitely does not need to exist, and like its lead, Christian Bale, it sometimes seems like it’s daring you to not like it. But what I’ve learned about Ridley Scott is even his dreck is pretty watchable.</p>
          <p>Less fun than <i>Robin Hood</i>, but a bit better in my estimation, if only because the story is more coherent. I guess we have the Bible to thank for that. Plus, the ten plagues of Egypt section was better than any sequence of <i>Robin Hood</i> by a fair shot. <i>Robin Hood</i> remains Ridley’s worst historical epic.</p>
          <p>This feels like the kind of movie that will never get made again post-COVID. Is anyone going to give any director, even Ridley Scott, this much money to make something that isn’t based on a proven IP when the theater business is limping into oblivion? Netflix ain’t making this movie.</p>
          <p>You could maybe trick Bezos into doing it.</p>

          <p>This movie is really hard to track down. I mean, you can’t even illegally download this thing (or so I’ve heard!). I was eventually able to get my hands on the Seattle Public Library’s lone DVD copy after months of waiting, made worse by the library system being shut down for a while due to COVID.</p>
          <p>It was mostly worth the wait. Theresa Randle should have had at least a bit more of a career. The Prince soundtrack is perfect for the movie. And, most importantly, Spike Lee is really having fun here, and it shows. Few directors are better at getting the joy they feel making movies up on to the screen.</p>
          <p>But ultimately there just isn’t enough story here to keep this thing alive. The ending (often not the strongest part of Spike’s movies, particularly early in his career) just kind of lands with a thud. And I have absolutely no clue what the point of Isaiah Washington’s character is.</p>
          <p>This is worth trying to track down because any movie directed by Spike Lee is worth seeing, but this falls pretty squarely near the lower middle of his filmography.</p>

          <p>Anyway, I was not looking forward to this one. Ridley just burned me with <i>Legend</i>, and an 80s movie I’ve never heard of with this title and Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers...I guess I judged the book by its cover. But it turns out Tom Berenger is really good in this. And you know what else? Mimi Rogers is really good in this. Also? This is a pretty good movie.</p>

          <p>I swear I’m not just trolling Halloween fans with my ratings for these movies.</p>
          <p>The thing I like about this movie is the plot is almost obscenely stupid, but the filmmaking, score, effects, (most of) the acting, and design are taken really seriously, which is a fun juxtaposition.</p>
          <p>It almost reminds me of a really bad Bond movie, with the villain strutting around bragging about his evil plan.</p>

          <p>Kinda surprised they just went with the classic Robin Hood costume.</p>
          <p>Oscar Isaac is just doing Joaquin Phoenix in <i>Gladiator</i>, right? And it turns out, as much as I love Oscar, he’s no Joaquin. I mean, it’s kind of embarrassing how much this is trying to be <i>Gladiator</i>, actually. Or, <i>Gladiator</i> by way of <i>Braveheart</i>. (Idea for romantic comedy period piece: <i>Gladiator, Actually</i>.)</p>
          <p>I have a growing appreciation for Russell Crowe, but he’s completely miscast here. Robin Hood is supposed to be sly and smooth and funny, none of which Russell really is. I would have much rather seen Ridley keep the other star of his previous movie (<i>Body of Lies</i>), Leonardo DiCaprio, around for this role.</p>
          <p>Anyway, there’s some promising stuff at the beginning, but it never really comes together. Eventually it just sort of gives up and ends. The least successful of Sir Ridley’s historical epics, and I’m including the one where Gérard Depardieu plays Christopher Columbus.</p>
          <p>Gotta go on record and say I’m getting pretty uncomfortable with the amount of rape or near rape or threats of rape there are in Ridley Scott’s movies.</p>

          <p>It’s interesting to see a movie from the pre-CGI era with one actor playing a set of twins. At first I was very distracted by this and was analyzing every shot with it in mind, but I forgot about it for most of the movie. The distraction started to creep back in by the end, though.</p>
          <p>This feels like second tier Cronenberg to me. Still visually interesting and full of creepy ideas, but a bit ponderous and flabbier than usual.</p>

          <p>Of the two Happy Madison movies I watched this year, this and <i>Hubie Halloween</i>, this was the more cynical and the more offensive, I think. David Spade is also a much less compelling comedic lead than Adam Sandler. But this was definitely the funnier of the two, and the better movie.</p>
          <p>Most of that is due to Lauren Lapkus, who is a revelation here even though I’ve been a fan of hers from podcasts for years and years. I’m just bummed that she has to be the romantic lead opposite old ass David Spade in this ridiculous wig.</p>

          <p>What a strange movie. I mean, not really — this is a totally straightforward story told straightforwardly. But the existence of a little movie about a regional funny car rivalry is strange enough; the fact that it was directed by David Cronenberg right in-between <i>Rabid</i> and <i>The Brood</i> really takes it to another level. Watching this immediately after seeing <i>Crimes of the Future</i> was particularly jarring.</p>
          <p>This is a pleasant enough movie, if a bit of a throwaway. I always like seeing forgotten movies like this that are real glimpses into a extremely specific time and place, whether that time and place ever actually existed. I’m pretty sure the ending makes absolutely no sense, but it involves a drag race between a funny car and an airplane, so it’s got that going for it.</p>

          <p>I really wanted to like this movie. And I did like parts of it. I like Demi Moore here, in a tough role both to prepare for and to play. I like a lot of the early stuff - the first hour or so is pretty consistently engaging. There are so many classic “that guy”s in this movie, too. Viggo is predictably good. Viggo’s mustache is unpredictably great.</p>
          <p>But this movie is trying to do way too many things, and is doing most of them poorly. There is some real 90s stuff weighing this thing down, too. The ENTIRE political intrigue subplot should have been cut.</p>
          <p>Also, the training sequence where Viggo beats the shit out of Demi and then threatens to rape her just to rally the troops around her is not only clearly offensive but also just laughably stupid.</p>

          <p>Anyway, this one really goes off the rails. It would have been so much fun if it hadn’t tried to get so real near the end. And then it went for like a Wes Anderson thing that kind of made me cringe. The material here isn’t doing the actors any favors.</p>

          <p>I feel like I watched this too soon. Watching it made me sad, because Jesus Christ, but also kind of bored, because this stuff just happened. And I obsessively read about it on Twitter.</p>
          <p>TBH, all Alex Gibney documentaries leave me a bit cold. Or bored. I think maybe it’s the excessive narration? Is that just this one, or all of them? The filmmaking just isn’t very dynamic, even by documentary standards. Which is a shame, because he picks great subjects. Steve Bartman, Scientology, Theranos, etc.</p>
          <p>It felt a bit jarring when he just dropped the George Floyd protest footage in the background without really commenting on it or explaining the context. Im not sure what that was meant to convey.</p>
          <p>Anyway, I guess this rating should be considered tentative. I’ll revisit in a few years. Or maybe I’ll never want to think about this stuff again.</p>
